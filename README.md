1. gender
2. age
3. estimated salary
### After doing parameter tuning and testing the dataset we got the following accuracies through each classifiers
1. K Nearest Neighbors=90.6
2. Naive bayes=87.6
3. Decision Tree=85
4. Kernel SVM(rbf)=90.3
5. Logistic Regression=82.6
6. Random Forest=90
7. SVM=82.6
### As we can see here K Nearest Neighbors classifier gave the highest accuracy that is 90.6 %
